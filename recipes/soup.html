        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the classic  Spanish chicken broth soup</p>
        <p>I love soup. I love all kinds of soups. But this one is close to my heart.</p>
        <p>My mother is the master of chicken broth soup, and this is how she does it:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken carcass....1</li>
            <li>Chicken rump....2</li>
            <li>Leek....1</li>
            <li>Carrot....1</li>
            <li>Parsley sprigs....4</li>
            <li>Parsnip....1</li>
            <li>Ham bones (optional, can make the broth very salty)....1</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a large pot with water to boil</li>
            <li>Add some salt and olive oil to the water</li>
            <li>Clean the carcass anda dd it to the water</li>
            <li>Add the chicken rumps to the water</li>
            <li>Peel the vegetables and cut them, then add them to the pot</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and let it cook for 2-3 hours</li>
            <li>Check regularly, so the water doesn't evaporate too much and you are left with very few broth (it happened to me)/li>
            <li>When th ebroth is ready, retire the bones and vegetables and strain</li>
            <li>You can leave the chicken rumps</li>
            <li>Cook come soup pasta in the broth</li>
            <li>You can freeze the rest of the broth, I usually make enough for 6-8 servings</li>
        </ol>
